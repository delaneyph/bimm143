Read the results TSV (Tab separated format) file from BLAST
```{r}
blast <- read.table("~/work/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv")
head(blast)
```


Set the column names
```{r}
colnames(blast) <- c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore")
```

Plot some aspects of these results
```{r}
plot(blast$pident  * (blast$qend - blast$qstart), blast$bitscore)
```


Let's try ggplot2
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(blast) +
  aes(pident, bitscore) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2)
```


We can have very high percent identity even for short alignments where the bitscore (alignment score) will not be that high. Let's try to dactor that into our analysis. 
```{r}
ggplot(blast, aes((pident * (qend - qstart)), bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) + geom_smooth()

```

I need to setup these packages:
install.packages("tinytex")
